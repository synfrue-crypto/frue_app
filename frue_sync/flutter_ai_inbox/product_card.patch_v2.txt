Updated: lib/widgets/product_card.dart
- Added badge overlay in image area (top-right) showing `assets/icons/{brand_quality}.png` when product['brand_quality'] is set (e.g., 'bio' or 'demeter').
- Switched image usage to the new `SmartAssetImage([imgId])` API which resolves via AssetRouter.

Reason: Provide visible bio/demeter badges in product grid as requested in SÜFRÜ UI spec.

Revision: further changes applied
- Replaced inline Image.asset badge rendering with centralized `QualityBadges` widget which normalizes messy `brand_quality` values (e.g., "Demeter, Bio") to the canonical icons.
- Adjusted lower card layout (Flexible / mainAxisSize.min and trimmed paddings) to avoid tiny RenderFlex overflow in tight grid cells.
