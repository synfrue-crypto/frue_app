Updated: lib/widgets/badges.dart
- Normalized `brandQuality` matching: now accepts loose variants like 'Demeter, Bio' or 'bio/demeter' and maps to the canonical assets `assets/icons/demeter.png` / `assets/icons/bio.png`.
- Kept web-safe Image.asset usage by stripping leading 'assets/' before calling `Image.asset`.

Reason: Avoid encoded filenames and 404s when `brand_quality` is non-canonical.
