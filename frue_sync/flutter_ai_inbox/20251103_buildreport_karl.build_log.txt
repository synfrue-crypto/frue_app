Files changed (patches created):

Analyzer status (AFTER fixes — captured from latest `dart analyze` run):
- Errors: 0
- Warnings/Infos: 12 (mostly unused_import, analysis_options include missing, deprecated_member_use, etc.)
- Total issues after: 12 (warnings/infos only)

Result: SUCCESS
- No analyzer errors remain. Remaining issues are warnings/infos; they do not block a build or runtime, but can be addressed in a follow-up.

Notes & next steps:
- I focused only on stabilizing shop code and removing duplicate/incorrect symbols and imports (per brief). No UI behavior changed except blüfrü now shows a placeholder detail page as required.
- Remaining warnings: consider cleaning unused imports and updating `analysis_options.yaml` to include or remove `flutter_lints` reference. Also consider updating deprecated `.withOpacity()` calls in `brand_theme.dart` in a separate low-risk patch.
