Updated: lib/widgets/smart_image.dart
- Removed `const` from SmartAssetImage constructor because `_flat` is non-const and the constructor cannot be const.
- This fixes the analyzer error: "Invalid constant value" when callers used `const [...]` as argument.

Validation: SmartAssetImage is now a normal constructor; callers may still pass non-const lists. Analyzer no longer reports invalid constant on this file.
